    <h1>1. BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This program is to use a function that compute the BMI and outputs a message depending on BMI value. <br>

        (1) For BMI that is less the 18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight." <br>
        
        (2) For BMI that is equal to 18.5 but less than 25, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight." <br>
        
        (3) For BMI that is equal to 25 above, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."</p>
